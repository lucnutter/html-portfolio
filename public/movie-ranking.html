<h1>The Best Movies of All Time</h1>
<h2>My Top 3</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>Classic break out of jail flick with great twist at the end.</p>
<h3>Wedding Crashers</h3>
<p>
  Ton's of quotable moments and great acting by Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn
</p>
<h3>ET</h3>
<p>
  One of the first movies I watched as a kid. Great soundtrack, great storyline,
  lots of fantasy and adventure. And the bike chase scene towards the end of the
  movie is also awesome.
